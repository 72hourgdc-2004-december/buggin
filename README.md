    How To Play
    Move your bug around the game world to find food. Use your jaws to chew up food (or other bugs) and use your feet to get away from hungry beetles.
    Once you've collected enough food, you can go back to the hole you crawled out of and mutate into a new type of bug with new abilities.
    If you are injured, you can also go back to your hole and use food to recover your health.
